/**
 * The default decimal number operations are unlimited precision. We
 * provide here additional predicates mp_decimal/3, mp_add/3, mp_sub/3,
 * mp_mul/3, mp_slash/3 and mp_int_pow/3 that provide limited precision
 * basic arithmetic operations. The predicate mp_decimal/3 reduces the
 * argument to the requested precision by using the proposed rounding.
 * It can do this for integer, float and decimal numbers.
 *
 * Examples:
 * ?- X is mp_decimal(1<<10, new_context(3)).
 * X = 0d1.02E+3
 * ?- X is mp_decimal(pi, new_context(3)).
 * X = 0d3.14
 * ?- X is mp_decimal(0d2.7183, new_context(3)).
 * X = 0d2.72
 *
 * The arithmetic predicates mp_add/3, mp_sub/3, mp_mul/3, mp_slash/3 and
 * mp_int_pow/3 proceed in that they first round the given arguments to
 * the requested precision. Then they compute the arithmetic operation
 * up to the requested precision. The predicate mp_int_pow/3 internally
 * computes with additional precision. Except for the argument and result
 * rounding, they donâ€™t introduce additional errors in the computation.
 *
 * Examples:
 * ?- X is mp_decimal(0d2.7183*0d2.7183, new_context(3)).
 * X = 0d7.39
 * ?- X is mp_mul(0d2.7183, 0d2.7183, new_context(3)).
 * X = 0d7.40
 *
 * The arithmetic predicates fall back to the ordinary operations if none
 * of the arguments are decimals and they might thus also produce integer
 * and float results. There is one exception to this rule for the predicate
 * mp_slash/3 which always produces a decimal.
