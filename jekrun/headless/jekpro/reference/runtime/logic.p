/**
 * When a goal belonging to a defined predicate is invoked a new
 * frame is created. When the interpreter encounters a cut (!) it
 * will remove all choice points inside this frame. The cut (!) will
 * also remove choice points that were created by disjunction (;)/2.
 * On these grounds the predicate (;)/2 is called cut transparent.
 *
 * Examples:
 * ?- X = a; X = b.
 * X = a ;
 * X = b
 * ?- X = a, !; X = b.
 * X = a
 *
 * Some of the predefined logical predicates are cut transparent in
 * all arguments. This includes the predicates (,)/2 and (;)/2.
 * Others are only cut transparent in the second argument. This
 * includes the predicates (->)/2 and (*->)/2. Other predicates,
 * such as call/1, once/1 and (\+)/1, are not cut transparent at all.
