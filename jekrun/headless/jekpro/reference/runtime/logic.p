/**
 * When a goal belonging to a defined predicate is invoked a new frame
 * is created. When the interpreter encounters a cut (!) it will remove
 * the choice points inside the frame. To instruct the interpreter that
 * cuts can nevertheless propagate a defined predicate can be marked as
 * cut transparent via the predicate property sys_nobarrier/1.
 *
 * Examples:
 * ?- X = a; X = b.
 * X = a ;
 * X = b
 * ?- X = a, !; X = b.
 * X = a
 *
 * Some of the predefined logical predicates are cut transparent in all
 * arguments. This includes the predicates (,)/2 and (;)/2. Others are
 * only cut transparent in a few arguments. This includes the predicates
 * (->)/2 and (*->)/2, and also the special forms in connection with the
 * predicate (;)/2. Others are not cut transparent at all. This includes
 * the predicates sys_call/1, call/1, once/1 and (\+)/1.
